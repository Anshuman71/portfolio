Thanks, everyone, for showing love and support to my work.

It gives me immense joy to share that my articles have been read more than **5k** times on this platform and **10k** times across platforms.

I started my writing journey this year, and I have already reached

- 250 followers on [DEV](https://dev.to/anshuman_bhardwaj)
- 150 followers on [Twitter](https://x.com/sun_anshuman)
- 4-weeks streak badge

It is such a milestone for me. It motivates me to write and share more with the community and gives new ideas to think about.

## My Process

I'm a fan of James Clear, and I followed his advice of repetitive action over perfection. He recommends building up a process rather than overdoing things. So, I set up a goal to write and publish one article per week. I've been able to keep up with it for over a month now, and I have published six posts, with 40 in the draft.

If you are planning to start, my advice would be to

- fix a schedule for yourself and follow it without questioning
- increase the frequency when it starts feeling too easy
- focus on your progress only, everyone else had a different start
- keep an idea box to add new ideas as draft
- keep improving your content and listen to what the audience likes

## What's next

- I'll publish articles twice a week
- I'll tweet once each day
- Aiming for the eight-weeks streak badge
