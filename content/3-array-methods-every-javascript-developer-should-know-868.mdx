Arrays are something all of us come across every day. Today I'll share my picks for 3 of the most uncommonly used Array methods.

## isArray

In JavaScript, we have to infer the data type of variables way too often, even more often in nested Objects. One of the ways most JavaScript developers do it _(including myself)_ is to check the length property

```ts

const data = { ... }

// true, if arrayKey exists and the arrayKey has a length property
(data?.arrayKey && data.arrayKey.length)

```

Although this works, what if I told you there is even a better way to do this?

The `Array.isArray(param: any)` call checks if the passed value is indeed an array or not and returns a boolean value.

```ts
Array.isArray([]); // true
Array.isArray(new Array(22)); // true

Array.isArray(0); // false
Array.isArray({}); // false
Array.isArray(null); // false
Array.isArray(undefined); // false
```

For the next two, let's consider a situation

You have to rate some students based on a test as follows

- failed: if **all** answers were _wrong_
- passed: if **some** answers were _correct_
- excellent: if **all** answers were _correct_

## some

The `Array.some()` methods run the provided function on each item of the array and return **true**, if the provided function returns true for **any** of them, otherwise **false**.

So in our scenarios, we can apply `Array.some()` for the second use case.

```ts

function isCorrectAnswer(answer) {
 // return true if the answer was correct, otherwise false
}

const answers = [{ ... }]

// didStudentPass will be true, if any of the answers were  // correct
const didStudentPass = answers.some(isCorrectAnswer)

```

## every

The `Array.every()` methods run the provided function on each item of the array and return **true**, if the provided function returns true for **all** of them, otherwise **false**.

`Array.every()` seems like a perfect fit for the other two scenarios.

```ts

function isCorrectAnswer(answer) {
 // returns true if the answer was correct, otherwise false
}

function isInCorrectAnswer(answer) {
 // returns true if the answer was wrong, otherwise false
}

const answers = [{ ... }]

// didStudentFail will be true, if all of the answers were incorrect

const didStudentFail = answers.every(isInCorrectAnswer)

// didStudentExcel will be true, if all of the answers were correct

const didStudentExcel = answers.every(isCorrectAnswer)
```
