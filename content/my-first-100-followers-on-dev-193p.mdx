First of all, thanks to the Dev community for giving feedback on my posts and appreciating my content. 

## How it started

I always had a thing for writing. I had been writing [Medium blogs](https://medium.com/@anshuman-bhardwaj) about my travel for some time now. It brings me joy to share and express myself through words.

During my college, I made a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9-rIQbbBVxJyTIWPdhK4YA) and posted tutorials about CPU simulators & assembly programming. It made me realize that I love to teach. Last December, when I checked, my channel reached 300 subscribers, and I thought, let's continue doing what I like. 

I thought this year let me start contributing to the Dev Community and resume making YouTube videos. So during this New Year's long weekend, I re-branded my YouTube channel and created a Dev account.

I've posted two articles on Dev and received more than 2k views with 150+ reactions and gained 100+ followers.

## Where it's headed

I've been a developer for four years now. Although I have a CS degree, I consider myself a self-taught engineer. I've grown so much in my career that at the age of 22, I'm an Eng. manager with five direct reports. I feel my experience will be a lot helpful for the community.

I plan to continue writing and making videos at least once per week. It would be an achievement to keep this going for a year.

## Goals

1. Improve my writing and speaking skills.
2. Create content that I can be proud of
3. Deliver one Dev post and a YouTube video per week. 
4. Earn the 4/8/16 week streak badges from Dev.
