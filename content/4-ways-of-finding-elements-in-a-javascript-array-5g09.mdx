Arrays are the building blocks for data-based web apps. We can store and manipulate data using an Array easily.

Today, we are going to see 4 ways to find an element in an Array, along with some use cases explained with examples.

## find

the `find` method returns the first item that returns true for the passed callback condition, otherwise returns `undefined` if all items return false for the callback condition.

```ts
const numbers = [1, 3, 4, 6, 10];

numbers.find((element) => element > 6); // 10

numbers.find((element) => element > 10); // undefined
```

---

## findIndex

the `findIndex` method returns the index of the first item that returns true for the passed callback condition, otherwise returns `-1` if all items return false for the callback condition.

```ts
const numbers = [1, 3, 4, 6, 10];

numbers.findIndex((element) => element > 6); // 4

numbers.findIndex((element) => element > 10); // -1
```

> The find methods are useful when you don't know exactly what you're looking for, but you know a way to identify it. For instance, you know the user's email but not the complete object.

---

## indexOf

the `indexOf` method returns the index of the first item that matches the passed element, otherwise returns `-1`.

```ts
const numbers = [1, 3, 4, 6, 10];

numbers.indexOf(10); // 4

numbers.indexOf(16); // -1
```

> The `indexOf` uses the same comparison logic as `===`. Hence, using it on an array of Object will not be a good idea.

---

## lastIndexOf

the `lastIndexOf` methods similar to `indexOf` we saw above, the only difference being it starts the look up from the tail end of the array.

So, it's a good idea to use `lastIndexOf` if you know that the element has a higher chance of being in the latter half.

```ts
const numbers = [1, 3, 4, 6, 10];

numbers.lastIndexOf(10); // 4

numbers.lastIndexOf(16); // -1
```

> The `indexOf` methods are useful when you know exactly what you're looking for. For instance, it's best to use them for primitive data types like number or strings.

## Summary

To summarise, I would suggest using

- `find`, when you don't know what you're looking for but you know how it should look.
- `findIndex`, to get the index of the element.
- `indexOf`, when you know exactly what you're looking for, and want the index of the element.
- `lastIndexOf`, when you know what you're looking for, you know it's somewhere at the end, and want the index of the element.
- when the array items are objects, `find` and `findIndex` are the way to go.
