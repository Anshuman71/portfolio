Asynchronous operations are crucial when working with web applications. We can all agree how easy async/await has made our lives while dealing with asynchronous operations. 

In this post, we are going to see how to use loops with async/await. 

Before we dive into it, here are the utility functions I used for the demo

```js

// creates a logger function to print logs with function name
function getLogger(fnName) {
  return function logger(value, diffInMS) {
    return console.log(
      `${fnName}: Item ${value} finished waiting ${Math.round(
        diffInMS / 1000
      )} seconds later.`
    );
  };
}

// simulates an async flow, a network request for example
async function waitFor(seconds) {
  // used to create the fancy waterfall
  fetch("https://random-data- 
         api.com/api/stripe/random_stripe" + Math.random());

  // the fake asynchronous task
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(resolve, seconds * 1000);
  });
}

```

## The classic For loop

```js
const list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 , 9, 10];

export async function mainWithFor() {
  const start = Date.now();
  const logger = getLogger("mainWithFor");
  for (const item of list) {
    await waitFor(2);
    const later = Date.now();
    logger(item, later - start);
  }
}
```

Runs the code sequentially, one by one. Waiting for each `waitFor` to finish before proceeding to the next iteration.

The image below shows a nice waterfall demonstration, look how each green section starts 2 seconds after the previous one. (don't worry about their duration, as it's a random endpoint. Only for the sake of waterfall depiction)

You'll also notice that the logs appear at a 2-second difference, one by one.

> A good use case for this approach would be to run sequential operations, where you want the next operation to run once the former has finished.

## The forEach higher-order method

```js
export async function mainWithForEach() {
  const start = Date.now();
  const logger = getLogger("mainWithForEach");
  list.forEach(async (item) => {
    await waitFor(2);
    const later = Date.now();
    logger(item, later - start);
  });
}

```
The `forEach` loop acts differently than the `for` loop, while the `for` loop `await` the iteration before moving further, the `forEach` loop executes all of the iterations simultaneously. So all the ten executions start at the same point and log after 2 seconds.

We can also observe the same using a waterfall diagram, look how they all began at the same time. (Again please ignore the duration of each execution, it's random-api).

> A good use case for this approach would be to run parallel operations, where you don't care if the previous one finished or not. It's much faster compared to `for` loop. But there is a caveat to this approach: if the api you're requesting has some sort of rate-limiting setup then making simultaneous requests can backfire.

## The map higher-order method

```js
export async function mainWithMap() {
  const start = Date.now();
  const logger = getLogger("mainWithMap");
  const promises = list.map(async (item) => {
    await waitFor(2);
    const later = Date.now();
    logger(item, later - start);
  });
  const finalAnswer = await Promise.all(promises)
}
```

The `map` function behaves exactly the same as `forEach` in terms of async operations, meaning all of the callbacks start at the same time and log exactly after 2 seconds.

On top of this, the `.map` returns an array of promises, (one promise per execution, in the same order). 

Later we can do a `await Promise.all(promises)` to get the final answer array from it.

_It should be noted that the Promise.all will reject completely if even a single one of the promises from the input array rejects._

> `map` should be used at places where you would need to return some data based on each async operation. If that's not the case, sticking with `forEach` wouldn't be a bad choice.
