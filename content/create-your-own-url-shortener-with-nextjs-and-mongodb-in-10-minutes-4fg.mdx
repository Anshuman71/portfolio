## Motivation

A few weeks back, I was working on a Twitter bot to post my popular articles and I realized that links of some articles are not parsed well in the Tweet. However, shortening them using [Rebrandly](https://www.rebrandly.com/) worked well. 

So, I decided to make a URL shortener for myself.

---
## Breakdown

We need a

- service to create a unique hash for each long URL
- database to persist long to short URL mapping
- service to redirect short links to their destination

As always, **Next.js** was my first choice for building the complete service and **MongoDB** for storing links.

---
## Development

Now that we have figured out the steps, let's work on them one by one

### Setup the project

Let's use the `npx create-next-app url-shortener` command to generate a boilerplate for our app.

```
./.env.local

DB_NAME=url-shortner
ATLAS_URI_PROD=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password><cluster>.mongodb.net/url-shortner?retryWrites=true&w=majority

API_KEY=<a-long-random-string>
HOST=http://localhost:3000
```

These environment variables should also be stored in your Vercel project.

> The value of `HOST` should be set to your domain when you host this project. If you don't have a public domain, just you `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_URL` environment variable instead of `HOST`.

### Setting up MongoDB

1. Run `npm i --save mongodb`
2. Create a `mongodb.ts` file at the root of the repo.

```ts
// ./mongodb.ts

import { Db, MongoClient } from "mongodb";
import { formatLog } from "./utils";

// Create cached connection variable
let cachedDB: Db | null = null;

// A function for connecting to MongoDB,
export default async function connectToDatabase(): Promise<Db> {
  // If the database connection is cached, use it instead of creating a new connection
  if (cachedDB) {
    console.info(formatLog("Using cached client!"));
    return cachedDB;
  }
  const opts = {
    useNewUrlParser: true,
    useUnifiedTopology: true,
  };
  console.info(formatLog("No client found! Creating a new one."));
  // If no connection is cached, create a new one
  const client = new MongoClient(process.env.ATLAS_URI_PROD as string, opts);
  await client.connect();
  const db: Db = client.db(process.env.DB_NAME);
  cachedDB = db;
  return cachedDB;
}

```

### Add create-short-link service

Go ahead and add a `./api/create-link.ts` file to create a REST endpoint for this service.

Couple of things we need to be aware of
1. A unique Hash is required to make short URLs. I used `nanoid` to generate a random short hash for the long URL.
2. This endpoint should only be accessed by the POST method.
3. We should set up an API-KEY authentication to secure the endpoint. This can be done by generating a long string and using it as an API-KEY header.


```ts
// ./api/create-link.ts

import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";
import connectToDatabase from "../../mongodb";
import { customAlphabet } from "nanoid";
import { COLLECTION_NAMES } from "../../types";

const characters =
  "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789";
const getHash = customAlphabet(characters, 4);

export default async function CreateLink(
  request: NextApiRequest,
  response: NextApiResponse
) {
  const apiKey = request.headers["api-key"] as string;
  if (request.method !== "POST" || apiKey !== process.env.API_KEY) {
    return response.status(405).json({
      type: "Error",
      code: 405,
      message: "Only POST method is accepted on this route",
    });
  }
  const { link } = request.body;

  if (!link) {
    response.status(400).send({
      type: "Error",
      code: 400,
      message: "Expected {link: string}",
    });
    return;
  }
  try {
    const database = await connectToDatabase();
    const urlInfoCollection = database.collection(COLLECTION_NAMES["url-info"]);
    const hash = getHash();
    const linkExists = await urlInfoCollection.findOne({
      link,
    });
    const shortUrl = `${process.env.HOST}/${hash}`;
    if (!linkExists) {
      await urlInfoCollection.insertOne({
        link,
        uid: hash,
        shortUrl: shortUrl,
        createdAt: new Date(),
      });
    }
    response.status(201);
    response.send({
      type: "success",
      code: 201,
      data: {
        shortUrl: linkExists?.shortUrl || shortUrl,
        link,
      },
    });
  } catch (e: any) {
    response.status(500);
    response.send({
      code: 500,
      type: "error",
      message: e.message,
    });
  }
}

```

### Redirect short links to destination

Now that we can create short links, let's add the logic to redirect users to the actual destination.

For that, we can make a dynamic route in Next.js app and write the redirect logic on the server-side.

```ts
// ./pages/[hash].tsx

import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse, NextPage } from "next";
import Head from "next/head";
import connectToDatabase from "../mongodb";
import { COLLECTION_NAMES } from "../types";

export async function getServerSideProps(request: NextApiRequest) {
  const hash = request.query.hash as string;
  const database = await connectToDatabase();
  const campaign = await database
    .collection(COLLECTION_NAMES["url-info"])
    .findOne({ uid: hash });

  if (campaign) {
    return {
      redirect: {
        destination: campaign.link,
        permanent: false,
      },
    };
  }

  return {
    props: {},
  };
}

const HashPage: NextPage = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Head>
        <title>URL Shortener</title>
        <meta name="description" content="Generated by create next app" />
        <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
      </Head>
      <h1>Requested link not found</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

export default HashPage;

```

This page will redirect the user to the destination if the `hash` value is available in the database otherwise, it'll show the "Link not found" message.

## Hosting

Hosting this project is a piece of cake because Next.js integration with Vercel is excellent. 

A simplified list of steps:
1. Push your Next.js project to a GitHub repository
2. Go to https://vercel.app and login with your GitHub account
3. Import the `url-shortener` repository by clicking on the "New Project" button on the Vercel dashboard.

You can also read about this in detail [here](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/overview).

Once done with the above steps, head to project settings and add the environment variables we defined in our `.env.local` file to the Vercel project's environment variables.

> You can also connect your custom domain to this project from the settings. 

ðŸŽ‰ Tada! Your URL shortener is ready and hosted now.

---

## What's next?

Well, you can continue to use this project as a REST API like I do or you can create a front-end to make it a web app.

> Before making it a public web app, make sure you put in additional security.

---

You can clone this project from this [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Anshuman71/url-shotener).
