Recently, I was reading one of my favorite author's articles on his website. I realized he has a reading progress bar at the top, which helps gauge how much of the article is left to read. 

I thought this makes for a good user experience, and I should add this to my articles on my [personal website](https://theanshuman.dev/articles/creating-a-read-progress-bar-in-react-and-tailwindcss-g1n) as well. So, I went ahead and did it.

## Breakdown

1. Find how much a user **can scroll** down on this page.
2. Find how much the user **has scrolled** down on the page.
3. Get the ratio by dividing the later by the former.

Voila, there we have our scroll percentage aka "reading progress".

## Code snippet

```ts
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

/**
 * React Hook to get the scroll percentage from the page, returns value from 0 to 100
 */
export function useReadingProgress() {
  const [completion, setCompletion] = useState(0);
  useEffect(() => {
    function updateScrollCompletion() {
      // see how much we have scrolled
      const currentProgress = window.scrollY;
      // see how much total scroll is available
      let scrollHeight = document.body.scrollHeight - window.innerHeight;
      if (scrollHeight) {
        setCompletion(
          Number((currentProgress / scrollHeight).toFixed(2)) * 100
        );
      }
    }
    // add scroll event listener
    window.addEventListener("scroll", updateScrollCompletion);

    // remove scroll event listener on umount
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener("scroll", updateScrollCompletion);
    };
  }, []);
  return completion;
}
```



The rest of the work is to show this information on the UI, for that, I just show a progress bar on the NavBar up top.

## Styling

I use TailwindCSS for my website and it was very easy to make this progress bar with it

```tsx
export default function NavBar() {
  const completion = useReadingProgress();
  return (
    <nav className="sticky z-50 top-0 backdrop-blur-3xl py-2">
      <span
        id="progress-bar"
        style={{
          transform: `translateX(${completion - 100}%)`,
        }}
        className={`absolute bottom-0 w-full transition-transform duration-150 h-1 bg-yellow-400`}
      />
      {/* Rest of the NavBar */}
    </nav>
  );
}
```

We use the `transform` and `translate` CSS properties to make the UI for the progress bar.

The `#progress-bar` is by default exists at the bottom of `NavBar` but by using `translateX` we move it across the X-axis.

Because we do `translateX(${completion - 100}%)`

- At 0% progress, it translates -100% on the X-axis,  making it _disappear_
- At 100% progress, it translates 0% on the X-axis, showing it _fully_
